* Our health is so important but so much time we don't care until fell something wrong, only then we go check how is our body, our health, to prevent this we need to have a Health Insurance. Now let's look the other way, imagine a person who work in a health insurance company and his boss gives him a dataset with 1000 people and need to know on average how much each customer will cost. For that is necessary a lot of time but if you have a Machine Learning it takes just few minutes, so thinking this in this article I built a predict model with Auto Machine Learning using Python and Pycaret and auxiliary libraries, **check the codes in notebook and there I talk more about the project**.
